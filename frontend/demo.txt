        make this tab as Question Paper Generator Which take same input as Syllabus Document id="syllabus" and Learning Objectives id="objectives" as input files and generate question paper with  such as 
        1. generate Assigment Que 
        2. generate MCQ quetion paper
        3. gerate Case Study question


here the api key for Gemini: AIzaSyA3cNeR9I2Su_JfbrjFQxEy2qOvjLW8CWE

make drop-down menu in UploadForm.jsx to select Ai-model from grox to gemini-pro
and add logic for question paper analysis by using gemini in ai_logic.py 

use following code for reference on how to integrate gemini using python
Install the Google GenAI SDK
Python

Using Python 3.9+, install the google-genai package using the following pip command:

pip install -q -U google-genai


Make your first request
Here is an example that uses the generateContent method to send a request to the Gemini API using the Gemini 2.5 Flash model.

If you set your API key as the environment variable GEMINI_API_KEY, it will be picked up automatically by the client when using the Gemini API libraries. Otherwise you will need to pass your API key as an argument when initializing the client.

Note that all code samples in the Gemini API docs assume that you have set the environment variable GEMINI_API_KEY.

Python

from google import genai

# The client gets the API key from the environment variable `GEMINI_API_KEY`.
client = genai.Client()

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash", contents="Explain how AI works in a few words"
)
print(response.text)


"Thinking" is on by default on many of our code samples

from google import genai
from google.genai import types

client = genai.Client()

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    contents="Explain how AI works in a few words",
    config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
        thinking_config=types.ThinkingConfig(thinking_budget=0) # Disables thinking
    ),
)
print(response.text)


use openrouter ai and add new ai model for analysis use following code for reference to make changes in ai_logic and 
make this model default in drop-down menu in ai-model list while loading UploadForm.jsx for first time

remove student mock data we don't need to add student data to make metric result 
instead have metric data on difficulty of question and make charts on the same 
use following data to make metric system on 
{
  "Q1 A": {
    "Difficulty Label": "Moderate",
    "Difficulty Score": 6.5,
    "Syllabus Alignment Score": 9,
    "Cognitive Level": "Apply",
    "Application Depth": 4,
    "Estimated Time to Solve": "10 minutes",
    "Marks vs Effort": "Balanced",
    "Concept Density": 3,
    "Question Type": "Descriptive",
    "Topic Weightage Match": "90%",
    "Complexity Index": 7.3,
    "Explanation": "Tests ER diagrams from core syllabus. Requires basic-to-intermediate design knowledge."
  }
}

Here are the top metrics you should include:

✅ Difficulty Score

✅ Cognitive Level (Bloom's)

✅ Application Depth

✅ Estimated Time to Solve

✅ Complexity Index

openrouter claude ai is only explaining 3 questions 
**Question: Q1 A**

1. **Difficulty Label**: Moderate
2. **Difficulty Score**: 6
3. **Syllabus Alignment Score**: 9
4. **Bloom's Taxonomy Level**: Create
5. **Application Depth**: 4
6. **Estimated Time to Solve**: 15 minutes
7. **Brief Explanation**: Designing an ER diagram requires understanding the requirements and translating them into a conceptual schema, which is a step beyond basic recall or comprehension. The task aligns well with learning objective 1, which focuses on designing ER diagrams. However, students may find it moderately challenging due to the necessity of considering organizational needs and making design decisions.

**Question: Q1 B**

1. **Difficulty Label**: Moderate
2. **Difficulty Score**: 7
3. **Syllabus Alignment Score**: 9
4. **Bloom's Taxonomy Level**: Apply
5. **Application Depth**: 3
6. **Estimated Time to Solve**: 12 minutes
7. **Brief Explanation**: Applying normalization techniques to identify candidate keys involves understanding and applying normalization rules. The question directly aligns with the second learning objective, which is about applying normalization concepts. This task requires an intermediate level of analysis to successfully complete the normalization steps given the dependencies.

**Question: Q2 A**

1. **Difficulty Label**: Moderate
2. **Difficulty Score**: 5
3. **Syllabus Alignment Score**: 7
4. **Bloom's Taxonomy Level**: Understand
5. **Application Depth**: 2
6. **Estimated Time to Solve**: 10 minutes
7. **Brief Explanation**: Illustrating concepts like varray or parallel database architectures involves demonstrating understanding with an example. These are part of emerging database systems, aligning somewhat with learning objective 4. It requires students to recall and apply their understanding in a relatively
